# Day 63 — Project Scenarios

API example (OpenWeatherMap):

`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apikey}`

---

## Scenario 1 — Weather Dashboard with Error Handling

Build a small weather dashboard that fetches current weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

### Requirements

- Make the API request asynchronously using `fetch` with `async/await`.
- Handle API request failures (for example, invalid city name) using `try/catch`.
- Create and throw custom errors based on weather conditions (e.g., extremely high or low temperature) and handle them appropriately.

### Suggested tasks

- Build a simple UI to input a city name and display the result.
- Show user-friendly error messages for network errors, invalid input, or API errors.
- Demonstrate at least one custom thrown error (e.g., `ExtremeTemperatureError`) and handle it in the UI.

## Scenario 2 — Bulk Email Sending Simulation with Parallel Promises and Error Handling

Simulate sending bulk emails to 5 users. Treat each email-sending operation as a `Promise` (simulate delays with `setTimeout`).

### Requirements

- Send all emails in parallel using `Promise.all`.
- If any email fails (e.g., due to a simulated random failure), catch the error and clearly indicate which specific email failed.
- Use a `finally` block to display a message indicating that the "Email process is complete." (regardless of success/failure).

### Suggested tasks

- Create an array of 5 mock email tasks that resolve or reject based on a random condition.
- Call `Promise.all` and handle success and failure cases. Show a breakdown of which emails succeeded and which failed.
- Ensure the `finally` block runs to update the UI or console indicating completion.

---

Optional: combine both scenarios into a small dashboard that fetches weather and then attempts to send a report-email, demonstrating error handling across both network and simulated async operations.
