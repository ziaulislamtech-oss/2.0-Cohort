SECTION 1: Objects and OOPS Thinking (Foundation)
	1.	Create a user object that stores name and email and has a login method which prints “User logged in”.
	2.	Imagine you now have 5 users.
First, think how you would manage them without using a class.
Then convert the same logic using a class and observe how the code becomes cleaner. Write code for both approaches.
	3.	Create a product object that stores name and price and has a method which returns the final price after discount.

The goal of this section is to understand why keeping data and behavior together makes code easier to manage.

SECTION 2: Classes and Objects
	4.	Create a Car class with the following:
brand
speed
a drive method that prints the car brand and speed
	5.	Create two different car objects from the same class and verify that their data is different.
	6.	Answer this in your own words:
If classes did not exist, how would you write this logic and what problems might occur when the project becomes large?

SECTION 3: Constructor and this keyword
	7.	Create a Student class whose constructor accepts name and roll number.
Add a method introduce that prints both values.
	8.	Inside the constructor, set values using this.
Then try removing this and notice what error occurs and why.
	9.	Create an object with two methods:
One method using a normal function
One method using an arrow function

Inside both, print this and observe the difference.

The goal is to clearly understand how this works and when it changes.

SECTION 4: Constructor Functions and Prototypes
	10.	Create a User constructor function (do not use class syntax).
	11.	Add a login method in two ways:
First, inside the constructor
Then, move the method to the prototype
	12.	Create two User objects and compare their login methods using equality.
Explain why the result is true or false.

The purpose here is to understand how prototypes help share behavior efficiently.

⸻

SECTION 5: call, apply, bind
	13.	Create a function that prints this.name.
	14.	Create an object that contains a name property.

Use call to run the function using the object
Use apply to run the function using the object
Use bind to create a new function and then call it
	15.	Borrow a method from one object and run it for another object using call.

The goal is to understand how this can be manually controlled.
